# Photo Frame

This is a photo carousel that rotates through your recent Facebook photos, intended for use in DIY digital photo frame. It should work fine in a cheap tablet or any other device, as long as it has a modern browser.

The app is built in React and TypeScript.

## Privacy

While the application authenticates with Facebook and requests basic+photo permissions, no data is stored by the application itself. Note that the [Facebook SDK for JavaScript](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/javascript/) may set some cookies, etc.
